# RWO
RepoWipeOut (RWO) is a Python tool that is made to simplify the process of deleting a repository with just a few clicks. The tool uses Python with Selenium for automation. 
Currently, the tool will wipe out all the repositories in your GitHub account.  
This project is still in development and needs a lot of upgrades.  
I will keep updating it whenever it's possible.

**What's next?**
1) Add more cases so the tool is fully automated:
a) Case 1: Allow the user to give input again if the credentials are wrong. - [Solved 05-08-2023]
b) Case 2: Automate the Login request while deleting a repository.

2) Give users the option to delete selected repositories.
3) Design a Gui and make a desktop application. (Hopefully cross-platform)
4) Automate the process of downloading required technologies in a Setup file.
